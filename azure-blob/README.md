<h1 class="large"><b>Azure Blob</b></h1>

This template deploys a basic Azure Blob solution.

<h2 class="small"><b>Overview and deployed resources</b></h2>

Azure Blob is a cloud-based storage solution which allows organizations to place unstructured data on a managed, higly durable, and highly resilient storage platform within the Azure cloud. Azure Blob storage provides routes for organizations to store data at varying price points depending on their specific needs, ranging from local region redundancy (read: a single data center) to multiple regions and availability zones at once (GZRS), with Standard (Hot and Cool possible with v2 Storage Accounts) and Premium performance levels available.

Azure Blob storage allows for standard understructured data (Blobs), Page blobs (like what backs OS and data disks in Azure), and Append blobs (primarily useful for log files). General Purpose v2 storage accounts can also host static web content from within the storage account.

The following resources are deployed as part of the solution
Azure Blob

    Resource type 1A: Resource group to contain all Azure Blob-related resources
    Resource type 1B: Storage Account(s) to house Blob containers
